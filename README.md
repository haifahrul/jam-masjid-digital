This is code fork from https://github.com/Mosque-Screens/Mosque-Screen. 

I decide to rebuild it with `react component` hooks and custom what we needs in Indonesian country.

This app can be customize like [Mosque Screen](https://github.com/Mosque-Screens/Mosque-Screen)

Thanks to `https://github.com/Mosque-Screens` contributors.
